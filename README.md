# CS-Foundation
CS-Foundation is a library that implements well-known data structures with some operators and algorithms to support them.

# Pure data structures
1. Matrices
2. Lattices
3. Graphs
4. B+ Trees
5. Type environment (Symbol table)

# Impure data structures
1. Queues
2. Stacks

# Algorithms
1. Gram-schimidt orthogonalization of a matrix
2. QR decomposition of a matrix
3. Backward substitution for solving equation systems
4. Tarski's fixed point theorem
5. Binary search on B+ trees

# Current todo
1. impure data structures
2. better api design
3. improve b+ so delete and rebalance is implemented
4. improve graphs to have nodes containing Maybe data
